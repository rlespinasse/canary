# Canary 🐤

Welcome to Canary, my personal testing playground for experimental code and development sandboxing.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a safe environment to:
- Prototype features before implementing them in production
- Run quick proofs of concept

## Contributing

This is a personal playground, you can propose but their a small possibility that the contribution will be used.

## Remember

Code here doesn't need to be perfect - that's the point! Experiment freely, break things, and learn from the process.

Happy testing! 🧪
